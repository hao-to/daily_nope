> Your personal CLI coach for unspirational self-improvement™.

Because sometimes, what you really need isn’t motivation –
but sarcasm, snacks, and a reason to laugh at your own chaos.

## 🤔 What is this?

The Daily Nope is a Python-powered CLI app that delivers snarky affirmations, confusing truths, and mildly chaotic prep-advice.

Choose your category:

- `affirmation` – You're enough. Just not for this.
- `motivation` – Get up. Or don’t. We won't judge.
- `preppin` – Prep like you mean it. Or like you have snacks.
- `gratitude` – Say thanks. Even if it's just to your coping mechanisms.
- `inner truths` – Spiritual-ish nonsense for existential flair.

```bash

✨ Why?

Because toxic positivity is exhausting, and you're doing your best.
This is for the realists, the overwhelmed, the ironically hopeful, and those who have no idea what they’re doing (but still show up).
